“The slovenly wub might well have said: Many men talk like philosophers and live like fools.”

I am Saurabh Bhatia, a programmer, writer, author, sci-fi writer and open source enthusiast. I am married to a wonderful girl and currently reside in Sydney, Australia. I love to cook, bush walk, watch movies and read comics in my free time. I was introduced to computers at a very early age and was always enticed by them. I am fortunate to make a career and always aim to keep myself updated with latest technology trends.
